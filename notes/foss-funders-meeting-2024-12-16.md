>   * Projects still need _competent_ people who _care_ enough to _contribute_.
>   * Funding can help, but not without the right people caring enough about the right issues.
> 3. Metrics is useful, but mainly for creating situation awareness.
>   * And the time you learn something from metric, it may be too late to address any root causes.
>   * Situation awareness is useless if one fails to act on it in time.
