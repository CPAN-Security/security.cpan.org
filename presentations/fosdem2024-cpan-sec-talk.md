### Why ask the question?

- Get an end-to-end overview of provenance
- Reduce false positives in downstream security tooling
- Ensure actionable information is available

## In-Scope Security Topics

Note:

Here are some of the things we care about!


[comment]: # (|||)

### Security Outreach & Information

ðŸ‘‰ Facilitating **responsible/coordinated disclosure** between authors, reporters and users.

* We register CVEs and **notify** stakeholders; **coordinate** and triage vuln reports; **help** authors and reporters, so **vulns don't get ignored**
    * CVE-2023-7101 **Spreadsheet::ParseExcel** (RCE affecting Barracuda Email Appliances)
    * CVE-2024-23525 & CVE-2024-22368 **Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX**
* Pre-release coordination via cpan-security@perl.org, and tools like CC/VINCE


Note:

Keep different information channels (websites, social media) up-to-date and relevant with info on incidents, best practices and other documentation.

VINCE â€“Â Vulnerability Information and Coordination Environment

Topics not under embargo are discussed on IRC

### Vulnerability Index

ðŸ‘‰ **Audit** and track vulnerabilities

* #TODO

Note:

Improve security awareness by standardizing and publishing CPAN package vulnerabilities in relevant indices (our own, or CVE, or other).


[comment]: # (|||)

### Provenance & Supply Chain Security

ðŸ‘‰ Establish a Secure CPAN Downloads

* #TODO â€“ TLS support in all CPAN clients (cpanpm, cpanm, etc)
* #TODO â€“ Implementing "The Update Framework" in CPAN
    * Repository signatures (yes this is from CPAN)
    * Author signatures (yes this is from AUTHOR)


Note:

We want to make TLS in cpan clients on by default, with cert verfiicaton on

Looking at getting The Update Framework (pypi has some implementation of this) as a supported, this is in addition to TLS

The TUF spec supports repo and author signing

TUF mitigates attacks that the current PGP signed CHECKSUMS implemetation is vulnerable to, like replay attacks and downgrade attacks,


[comment]: # (|||)

### Metadata & Software Bills of Materials

ðŸ‘‰ **SBOM** creation and verification

* #Ongoing â€“ CPAN PackageURL in spec
* #TODO â€“ PackageURL-enabled CPAN tooling
* #TODO â€“ SBOM-enabled CPAN tooling

Note:

Support risk analysis and management by writing tooling for managing standard SBOM objects like OWASP CycloneDX or SPDX, and do this by using existing and new CPAN metadata.

Improve interoperability with non-CPAN package indices


[comment]: # (|||)

### Transparency Logs

ðŸ‘‰ Tooling for **third-party monitoring** of&nbsp;package&nbsp;changes

* #TODO â€“ Sigstore for CPAN

Note:

Write tooling for monitoring package updates and integrity checking of metadata using tools like `sigstore` or `sigsum`, or take inspiration from `transparency.dev`.


[comment]: # (|||)

### Security Patch Tooling

ðŸ‘‰ Tooling for CPAN Distro security patches to enable high-priority updates

* #TODO

Note:

Enable high-priority updates of CPAN packages, by developing tooling for publishing and applying third-party security patches to CPAN distributions with non-responsive authors.
