## We care about…

Note:

Here are a few of the topics we care about!


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Vulnerability Index

**Auditing** and tracking vulnerabilities

Note:

Standardization and publishing of CPAN package vulnerabilities in relevant indexes (our own, or CVE or whatever). Also consider registering as a CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) 


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Provenance

Establishing a **trusted publishing infrastructure**

Note:

Establishing a trusted publishing infrastructure, including tooling and integration with in-toto.io and SLSA


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Software Bills of Materials

**SBOM** creation and verification

Note:

Tooling for creating and managing standard SBOM objects like OWASP CycloneDX and SPDX, using existing CPAN metadata


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Transparency Logs

Tooling for **third-party monitoring of updates** to ecosystem packages

Note:

Tooling for monitoring updates, but also integrity checking of metadata using tools like sigstore


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Security Patch Tooling

Tooling for CPAN Distro security patches to enable **high-priority updates**.

Note:

Develop tooling for publishing and applying third-party security patches to CPAN distributions that have non-responsive authors, to enable high-priority updates to CPAN packages.


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Security Outreach & Information

Security and incident communication through relevant media channels

Note:

Keeping the different security information channels and documentaion up-to-date and relevant info on incidents, best practices and usage documentation. Websites, social media and more.

### And more!

* Governance & Policy
* Rich Metadata & Dependencies
* Software Composition Analysis
* Metadata Privacy and Compliance

Note:

* Rules, project management and funding
* Integration with non-CPAN package indices
* Tooling for analyzing dependencies for known vulnerabilities
* Tracking legal and privacy issues around CPAN metadata, and compliance with GDPR, NIS2, and other regulations
