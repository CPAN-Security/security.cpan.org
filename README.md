Welcome to the [CPAN Security Working Group](https://security.metacpan.org/).
This is a community effort for supporting and responding to security incidents.
We also care about related concerns with CPAN distributions, like improving supply chain security and making CPAN become a more secure and trustworthy publishing platform.
